# Crypto Solver
A solver for the crypto puzzle:

Given numbers={9,10,10,6,2} find an equation composed only of (+,-,*, \/) using all the given numbers that results in the goal.

For example:


**numbers**={9,10,10,6,2} and **goal** = 1

**Solution**: ((10/10) / (9 â€“(6+2)))


The code solves it in many ways, including some heuristics explaineds in the document (CryptoHeuristics.pdf)
